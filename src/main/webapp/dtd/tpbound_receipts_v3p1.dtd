<!ELEMENT SERVICEID (#PCDATA)>   
  <!-- INT, service of message -->

<!ELEMENT SOURCE_ADDR (#PCDATA)> 
  <!-- originating mobile number in international format -->

<!ELEMENT TRANSACTIONID (#PCDATA)> 
  <!-- max. 50 characters. allocated by the third party service when MT was requested. -->

<!ELEMENT NETWORKID (#PCDATA)>
  <!-- 
    The network that generated the status has been generated where applicable.
    Possible values :
    -1 when not applicable e.g. a WIN internal interim status.
     1 =Voda
     2 = O2
     3 = Orange
     4 = TMobile
     etc...
     See Interface Definition Document for more comprehensive list.

     NOTE this NetworkID is NOT necessarily the network of the mobile phone 
     targeted with an MT.
     E.g. a free to end user MT targeted at a Vodafone phone may get delivered via O2

     A complete list of the possible NetworkID values is available within 
     CommonIdentifiers.DOC from the standard gateway readme.htm page.
  -->

  <!ELEMENT STATUSID (#PCDATA)> 
    <!-- 
    INT see User Guide for details 
    A complete list of possible values is within the Interface Definition Document.
    Some statuses are interim, some are final.
    Which are received are effected by the delivery receipt type choice within the MT request.
    The IDD also provides a guide as to when to retry failed deliveries.
    Some common values are :
      1	WIN Processing
      2	Delivered To Network (final)
      3	Delivered To Network (intermediate)
      4	Operator is Retrying Message
      5	Delivered To Phone
      etc

  <!ELEMENT STATUSDATETIME (DD, MMM, YYYY, HH, MM, SS)> <!-- Time message arrived -->

  <!ELEMENT DD (#PCDATA)>   <!-- Day of month (1-31) -->
  <!ELEMENT MMM (#PCDATA)>  <!--3 character month description (JAN, FEB ... DEC) -->
  <!ELEMENT YYYY (#PCDATA)> <!-- year  -->
  <!ELEMENT HH (#PCDATA)>   <!-- Hour of day (0-23) -->
  <!ELEMENT MM (#PCDATA)>   <!--Minute of hour (0-59) -->
  <!ELEMENT SS (#PCDATA)>   <!--Seconds of minute (0-59) -->

  <!-- Message Fragments
  Some messages are encoded at WIN resulting in multiple fragments e.g. Ringtones.
  For these, each of the fragments results in status codes being issued.

  Thus the  addition of elements for the delivery receipt reporting of 
  fragments for multipart messages :
  -->

<!ELEMENT TOTALFRAGMENTNO (#PCDATA)> 
  <!-- 
  INT, total number of encoded sms msgs 
  This is the total number of fragments for the overall message group

  i.e. For ring tone conversion, fragment 0 of 3 would relate to the parent initial 
  request, and 1, 2 and 3 to the fragments created as result of the request.
  -->

<!ELEMENT FRAGMENTID (#PCDATA)>     
  <!-- 
  INT, to which encoded sms msgs number this delivery receipt relates 
  This is the fragment number within the group i.e. 2 of 3 etc. 
  -->
