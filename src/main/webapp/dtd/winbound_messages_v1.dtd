  <!-- General Comments
  If WIN receive a valid XML document that contains unexpected data in 
  any of the elements then the SMS will not be sent out.
  E.g. a CostID that is not on the application/configuration Form.
  Those clients that request V3 delivery receipts will receive 
  status updates to this effect.

<!ELEMENT DESTINATION_ADDR (#PCDATA)>

<!ELEMENT TEXT (#PCDATA)> 
  <!-- 
  Message text up to 160 characters.  If greater than 160 chars
  the value will be truncated to 160 characters and sent out.

<!ELEMENT TYPEID (#PCDATA)>

<!ELEMENT SERVICEID (#PCDATA)> 
  <!-- 
  the originating service within the third party, these are defined
  in the client application form, provides a breakdown of messages 
  in the reports.
  -->

<!ELEMENT COSTID (#PCDATA)>
  <!-- 
  Provides the charge band 
  e.g. 1 = free. These are defined in the client application form 

  As well as being used to set the cost to the end user of an MT, 
  CostIDs also perform a message routing capability, 
  by having a secondary attribute : Routing ID. 

  The RoutingID values are a set part of a clients configuration.

  The RoutingID effects the network upon which a message will be dispatched
  and the Originator Address (OA) substitution support :
 
  The possible routing types are :
 
  1 ON-NETWORK
    The messages are dispatched via the network of the 
      target mobile phone (when known).
    Use this for :
      UK Premium Rate (PR) traffic
      UK On-Network FOC (Free of Charge) traffic. 
  4 SNR (Single Network Routing)
    The messages are dispatched via a fixed network independent of the 
      target mobile phone network.
    Use this for :
      For dispatch of free messages via the WIN least busy network engine 
        (one of Vodafone, mmO2, Orange, T-Mobile)
      FOC/PR non-UK network 
        (e.g. Germany, Austria (MATERNA), Ireland (PUCA), Manx Telecom)

  Note there are crossover routing considerations when Originator Address (OA) 
  substitution is required.  See ELEMENT SOURCE_ADDR description.

  Originator Address (OA) substitution support :
  Dynamic OA support :
    T-Mobile
    WIN least busy network engine

  Static OA support :
    Vodafone 
    O2      
    Orange  
  OA substitution on all other networks is unsupported.

<!ELEMENT NETWORKID (#PCDATA)>
  <!-- 
  Messages that are to result in a charge to the end user must be dispatched
  using the same network as that of the target phone.

  For target phones that have previously been sent in a message (or IMSI look up)
  WIN will have a record of the phones network.

  This element value is only used when third party decide to take responsibility 
  of validating the network of customers.

  In the circumstances of one of the following :
    WIN taking responsibility for validating the network (configuration setting)
    The NetworkID element not being present
    The NetworkID element not being set to 0 
  The following logic will be used to determine the network :
  1) Look for a record of the phone number's network on the WIN database.
     If not found then ...
  2) Look for a match for the prefix of the phone number to an OFTEL lookup. 
     If not found then ...
  3) If the message request is for a reverse billed message then block message.

  (Free messages will never be blocked.)  

  For certain overseas networks an alternative approach is required for premium rate traffic : 
  A CostID must be used with Single Network Routing to the appropriate NetworkID :
                 NetworkID
    German       87
    Irish        50
